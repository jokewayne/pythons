# This script demonstrates how Python scripting can be used to interact
# with CRT and manipulate an spreadsheet file (for reading by other
# programs such as Microsoft Excel). This script uses Python's csv library
# to create a spreadsheet, then it sends a command to a remote server
# (assuming we're already connected). It reads the output, parses it and
# writes out some of the data to the spreadsheet and saves it.  This
# script also demonstrates how the WaitForStrings function can be used to
# wait for more than one output string.
